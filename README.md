Demo01: Just a simple comperason between a body with and without drag. No controls.
Demo02: An airplane flying with only drag appliers modeled roughly modeled after the plain, and a add force motor. Controlls: WASD & QE.
Demo03: Two piles of debris, left pile has no drag appliers, right one has. Explode first with '1' and second with '2', reser with 'R'.
Demo04: Sumbarine created the same way as the airplane, only higher drag, no gravity and a simple buoyancy script added. Controlls: WASD.
Demo05: Four ragdolls falling in the air, first pair only uses normal uniform Rigidbody drag on impact and no gravity. Second pair use drag appliers.
