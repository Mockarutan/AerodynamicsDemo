* **Demo01**: Just a simple comparison between a body with and without drag. No controls.  
* **Demo02**: An airplane flying with only drag appliers modeled roughly modeled after the plain, and a add force motor. Controls: WASD & QE.  
* **Demo03**: Two piles of debris, left pile has no drag appliers, right one has. Explode first with '1' and second with '2', reser with 'R'.  
* **Demo04**: Submarine  created the same way as the airplane, only higher drag, no gravity and a simple buoyancy script added. Controls: WASD.  
* **Demo05**: Four ragdolls falling in the air, first pair only uses normal uniform Rigidbody drag on impact and no gravity. Second pair use drag appliers.
